(: This module should be placed in the server's Modules
   directory.  You must also amp the register-user function
   with admin privilege.
      Admin Console -> Amps -> Add
         Local Name = register-user
         Namespace = http://www.w3.org/2003/05/xpath-functions
         Document URI = /user-lib.xqy
      Check admin role
:)
xquery version "1.0-ml";

module namespace userlib = "http://www.w3.org/2003/05/xpath-functions";

declare default element namespace "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml";

import module namespace sec = "http://marklogic.com/xdmp/security" at
